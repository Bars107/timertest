Main points:

1. Project structure build according to clean architecture
2. Using DI just for the project to be more according to the common practices
3. No tests, I don't see any point in testing the SharedPreferences, and for UI tests I din't had time
4. A bit of error handling there, not neccesary, but this app to be extended and download data from BE, the errors on loading can occur
